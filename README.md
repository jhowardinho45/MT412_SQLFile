# Reviewing Students Data - Basic SQL Functions

## Overview 

For my SQL project, I decided to look at a student data set - containing info such as their college grades, stress levels and expected salaries. I started by implementing data cleaning through Jupyter Notebooks before using basic functions to get information on the students. I got this dataset from Kaggle '(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/susanta21/student-attitude-and-behavior)'.

## Repository Contents

`studentattitudeandbehaviour.csv`: original file from Kaggle.

`cleaningstudentbehaviourandattitudefile.ipynb`: python file used for data cleaning.

`cleanedstudentdata.csv`: cleaned file, exported through Jupyter.

`studentdata.sql`: studentattitudeandbehaviour.csv

## What can be seen in this file?

-Data Cleaning.

-SQL Table Creation.

-SQL Basic Functions.

## What's needed to run this code?

- PGAdmin4.

## What was used for data cleaning?
- Python 3 (I used Jupyter Notebooks).
- pandas library for python.

  
## How to Access for Yourself?
Click on `studentdata.sql` and download raw file, then open PGAdmin4, Select or create a database, then Select Open File and then upload onto PGAdmin4.
